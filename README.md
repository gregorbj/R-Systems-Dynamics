# R-Systems-Dynamics
This repository contains code and documentation for several programs for learning system dynamics model development using the R programming language. The example programs in the 'sys_dyn_in_r' directory are copied from the book "Systems Dynamics Modeling with R" by Jim Duggan. I found this to be a great introduction to system dynamics modeling and how to implement system dynamics models in R. The repository also includes code and documentation for a modified SEIR infection model for the novel corona virus (S=susceptible, E=exposed, I=infected, R=recovered) for the novel corona virus where the I component is split into asymptomatic, mild, and severe subcomponents and the R component is split into recovered and deceased subcomponents. Users can play around with parameters for total population, initial number of infected, quarantine rate, latency duration, symptomatic duration, hospital duration, asymptomatic proportion, hospitalized proportion, and proportion of hospitalized who die. The model also allows users to specify 2 levels of 'social-distancing' and infection thresholds that trigger each level.
