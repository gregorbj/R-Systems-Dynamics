# R-Systems-Dynamics
This repository contains code and documentation for several programs for learning system dynamics model development using the R programming language. Most of the example programs are drawn from the book "Systems Dynamics Modeling with R" by Jim Duggan. I found this to be a great introduction to system dynamics modeling and how to implement system dynamics models in R. The repository also includes code and documentation for a modified SEIR infection model (S=susceptible, E=exposed, I=infected, R=recovered) where the I component is split into asymptomatic, mild, and severe subcomponents and the R component is split into recovered and deceased subcomponents.
